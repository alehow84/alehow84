Hi I'm Alex🐣 I'm at the beginning of my developer journey and excited to see where it leads. 
My pronouns are she/her and I have two mischievous cats called Suki & Ziggy.
Two truths and a lie about me: Charlie Dimmock signed a kite I made at the millenium dome, I've jumped out of a plane and I have a neighbour called Phillip that occassionally tries to break in to my house!
