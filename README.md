### Helloooo
I'm Alex and the beginning of my developer journey ðŸ¤“
My pronouns are she/her and I have two mischievous cats called Suki & Ziggy.
I'm part way through a FrontEnd course with SheCodes and will soon have completed a Software Development bootcamp with NorthCoders. I also completed a Python taster course at the start of 2023.
I've loved what I've learned so far and am hoping to switch careers into a tech role.
Two truths and a lie about me: Charlie Dimmock signed a kite I made at the millenium dome, I've jumped out of a plane and I have a neighbour called Phillip that occassionally tries to break in to my house!
